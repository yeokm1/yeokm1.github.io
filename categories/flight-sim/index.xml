      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (FS2020), many videos have been shared online. However, few have been made on Singapore. Of those that do, most players fly from Changi Airport and to the city area which are off-limits in real life and they hardly use any real-world procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, General Aviation (GA) for visual flying within Singapore is limited to &lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2019/06/notes-on-flying-in-wssl-and-sg-training-area/&#34;&gt;Seletar Airport (WSSL) and the local Light Aircraft Training Area (LATA)&lt;/a&gt;. I have personally made many flights from WSSL although mostly to the local training area in the Northern part of SG. So I thought why not I conduct flights in this game as close as I can to a real plane and see how this stacks up to the real thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Check out the Chinese version of this post &lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/zh/2020/08/flight-simulator-2020%E8%B7%9F%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E5%AE%9E%E9%99%85%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%9B%B8%E6%AF%94/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
