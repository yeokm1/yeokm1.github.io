      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the GE2020 now over, we know the PAP has been returned to power safely with a more than comfortable supermajority margin. Prior to polling day, PAP candidates raised the possibility of PAP losing their majority in a freak election and the alternative side stating the opposite scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I googled around but never actually found any article that examines the risk of a Freak Election with respect to the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system. Could the GRC system possibly aggravate the risk of this PAP-wipeout freak election scenario against just having all Single Member Constituencies (SMC)?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the last of the 3-part book-review series on the Air-conditioned Nation series of books written by the academic Cherian George (CG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-series-by-cherian-george-part-1-of-3/&#34;&gt;Singapore: The Air-conditioned Nation Essays on the politics of comfort and control (2000)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-series-singapore-incomplete-by-cherian-george-part-2-of-3/&#34;&gt;Singapore, Incomplete: Reflections on a First World nation’s arrested political development (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/08/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-revisited-by-cherian-george-part-3-of-3/&#34;&gt;Air-Conditioned Nation Revisited: Essays on Singapore Politics (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;singapore-the-air-conditioned-nation-revisited-2020&#34;&gt;Singapore: The Air-conditioned Nation Revisited (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;images/air-con-nation-revisited.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/air-con-nation-revisited.jpg&#34; width=&#34;600&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m departing from the usual style of writing book reviews by putting my conclusion and summary at the top as some context I feel is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is different from the earlier books in that it republishes many of the essays written in the previous 2 books. This book is just 3 years away from the previous version hence it&amp;rsquo;s understandable that there isn&amp;rsquo;t much additional content unlike the 17-year gap between the first and second book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone like myself who just completed this series in quick succession, it actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a &amp;ldquo;revisit&amp;rdquo; to me. For a new reader who is short of time, reading this latest book is sufficient instead of the entire series. CG has selectively chosen the best of the previous essays that are still relevant today with some more recent additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence to that, I&amp;rsquo;ll only focus more deeply on the additional content which are actually only just 3 chapters. 3 chapters which are targeted at modern times given the recency of this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second of a 3-part book-review series on the Air-conditioned Nation series of books written by the academic Cherian George (CG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-series-by-cherian-george-part-1-of-3/&#34;&gt;Singapore: The Air-conditioned Nation Essays on the politics of comfort and control (2000)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the first book, this book contains non-linear essays written by him but slightly updated to the times 17 years after he wrote his first book. I shall pick out certain points of selected chapters which I felt impacted me the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Book Review: Air-conditioned Nation series by Cherian George (Part 1 of 3)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard of this term &amp;ldquo;air-conditioned nation&amp;rdquo; for more than a decade but I never actually read the book where this term originated from. Now, I finally did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Singapore: The Air Conditioned Nation&amp;rdquo; book was initially published in 2000 by the academic Cherian George (CG). Over the span of 20 years, he published 3 books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-series-by-cherian-george-part-1-of-3/&#34;&gt;Singapore: The Air-conditioned Nation Essays on the politics of comfort and control (2000)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/07/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-series-singapore-incomplete-by-cherian-george-part-2-of-3/&#34;&gt;Singapore, Incomplete: Reflections on a First World nation’s arrested political development (2017)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://yeokhengmeng.com/2020/08/book-review-air-conditioned-nation-revisited-by-cherian-george-part-3-of-3/&#34;&gt;Air-Conditioned Nation Revisited: Essays on Singapore Politics (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these books hold a collection of none-linear essays written by CG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the length of all 3 books and some reviews have already been published by much more qualified people, I shall selectively pick out certain points which I felt impacted me the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the review of the first book with the subsequent books to follow in more posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Choose any country of the world that practices military conscription and discuss whether the policy is necessary and/or desirable. What kind of arguments would you make for or against military conscription? Got B+ for this essay and A- for the module in total. I must have did very well for the finals to get that grade heh!.
Military conscription or the draft is defined as the compulsory enrolment of a country’s citizens for military service.</description>
