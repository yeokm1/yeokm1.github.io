    <p>I was in the market recently for a new phone as I had to give my previous Google Pixel 2 away to a family member in need of one. With the emphasis these days on sustainability and environmentally-conscious purchasing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone_3">Fairphone 3</a> came up at the very top of my research.</p>
<p>From the marketing words of this social enterprise, <a href="https://shop.fairphone.com/">&ldquo;Recycled and fair materials&rdquo;, &ldquo;Modular and repairable design&rdquo;, &ldquo;A commitment to fairness&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Fairphone_3">10/10 score on iFixit&rsquo;s Repairability Rating</a>, I was sold!</p>

<p>Notice that contents of the box is just the phone, instruction manual and a screwdriver! I&rsquo;m totally cool with this, don&rsquo;t ship the cable and charger unless you need it.</p>
<p>I went ahead to purchase and it arrived a few days ago. So after a few days of usage and some itchy hands with the screwdriver, I&rsquo;ll sum things up with this blog post!</p>
<p>Many reviews have already been posted online so much so that <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/curated-list-of-reviews-of-the-fairphone-3/52302">Fairphone has a curated list of reviews</a>. Nevertheless, I shall share my thoughts on those aspects that I felt are important to me.</p>
<h1 id="specifications-pixel-2-vs-fairphone-3">Specifications (Pixel 2 vs Fairphone 3)</h1>
<p>For comparison purposes, I shall compare the Fairphone 3 with my previous phone the Google Pixel 2. This may not seem like fair comparing phones 2 years apart but let&rsquo;s see shall we.</p>

<p>Other than the size-related aspects, both phones have very similar specifications despite being 2 years apart which will obviously position the FP3 on the mid-low performance tier today. It goes to show that pure feature count is not the main focus for Fairphone.</p>
<p>For the rest of the review, I&rsquo;ll be using the Pixel 2 as a point of reference since that is a wildly-recognised phone model and what I have been using so far.</p>
<h1 id="modular-and-repairable-design">Modular and Repairable Design</h1>
<p>When a manufacturer uses those words ^^^, of course I want to put them to the test. iFixit has already done a professional job in their <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fairphone+3+Teardown/125573">Fairphone 3 Teardown</a> so I won&rsquo;t go to the extent of their effort. Nevertheless, I still wanted to test their claims out myself since after all, I volunteer at <a href="https://repairkopitiam.sg/">Repair Kopitiam</a> where I take things apart every time.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back-1024x793.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Turning the phone over and removing the provided TPU bumper &ldquo;made from bio-based oil&rdquo;. The back cover is translucent with inspiring words bleeding through.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back-opened.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back-opened-1024x737.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Just popping out some catches and the rear cover is out! Battery is easily removed too! Wow, my first phone with removable-battery in years!</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-screwdriver-opening.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-screwdriver-opening.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Subsequent steps are more involved and need some screwdriver work. I tried using the provided screwdriver. Honestly, although it works with some effort, one is advised to use a screwdriver with a larger handle.</p>
<p><a href="images/fp3-half-opened.jp"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-half-opened-1024x896.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After removing all the screws, the display panel is easily separated! Wows again! In most other phones, you&rsquo;ll have to melt some messy glue with a hot air gun. Spy the Top, Camera, Speaker and Bottom module which are ripe for further removal.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-modules-out-1024x1004.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-modules-out-1024x1004.jpg"></a></p>
<p>A few more screws and some flex cable removing later, the 4 modules fall out easily. Here is where I stop further disassembly as what&rsquo;s below the metal shield are the sensitive SoC, modem and other chips which I&rsquo;m hesitant to potentially damage. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Fairphone+3+Teardown/125573">iFixit has already done a great job in that area</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-modules-back.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-modules-back-1024x649.jpg"></a></p>
<p>A close-up look at the back of the modules. They are really so cute and easily removed. If for example the USB port is damaged, you can <a href="https://shop.fairphone.com/en/spare-parts">purchase spare parts online from Fairphone</a>. You can see that spare parts from their earlier FP1 and FP2 models are still available.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-lcd-screws.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-lcd-screws.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After fixing a product, it is common procedure to test things out before putting back all the screws. Just do take note to at least put in these 2 screws which couple to the electrical connector of the LCD connector. I didn&rsquo;t initially put these in and got a scare when my display did not come on after turning the phone on.</p>
<p>Disassembling and assembling the phone is quite fun as one does not get this opportunity with any other phone. I encourage all Fairphone owners to disassemble their phone at least once to feel the level of empowerment. Just don&rsquo;t do it too often as I don&rsquo;t think the internal connectors are rated for many insertion cycles.</p>
<h2 id="usage-and-performance">Usage and Performance</h2>
<p>The first thing that I noticed when I started using the FP3 was how similar it was to the Google Pixel experience. No bloat or unnecessary software installed by the manufacturer unlike some other Android brands.</p>
<h2 id="performance-benchmark">Performance Benchmark</h2>
<p>As I have no easy means of easily comparing the 2 phones, I shall turn to a synthetic benchmark <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antutu.ABenchMark">Antutu Benchmark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-antutu.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-antutu.jpg"></a></p>
<p>My first time benchmarking phones actually. :) As you can see, the FP3&rsquo;s performance is nothing to write home about and it scores near to the bottom of phones in the market. The 2-year-old Pixel 2 beats it by a very significant margin.</p>
<p>On a day-to-day usage, I can confirm the FP3 seems slightly less responsive than the Pixel 2 when it comes to launching applications and scrolling through photos.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>Here is one area where the pros can do it better. <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/">Dxomark</a> gives a score of <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/fairphone-3-camera-review/">66 for the FP3</a> and <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/google-pixel-2-reviewed-sets-new-record-smartphone-camera-quality/">99 for the Pixel 2</a> so the comparison is obvious. With the work already done, I can skip this section right?</p>
<p>I still want to do a basic test by taking a day shot of the industrial park beside my block. Photos below are taken with the default camera app at default auto settings. Click on the photos to view the full-size image.</p>
<h3 id="fairphone-3">Fairphone 3</h3>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-camera.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-camera-1024x768.jpg"></a></p>
<p>4000x3000, 5.37MB</p>
<h3 id="pixel-2">Pixel 2</h3>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-pixel2-camera-1024x768.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-pixel2-camera-1024x768.jpg"></a></p>
<p>4032x3024, 2.90MB</p>
<p>Immediately the colours from the Pixel 2 appear much more natural whereas the FP3 has that blue tint. I&rsquo;m unsure why the file size difference of the FP3 is almost double. The FP3 image appears to be sharper as a result when you zoom in but not by much and not enough to justify the huge file size difference.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally take night shots but I do understand that Pixel&rsquo;s Night Sight feature works really well. In practice, most photos I take are posted to social media where lower resolutions suffice and colour is thus more important. This is one area where I&rsquo;ll make a significant downgrade by switching to the FP3.</p>
<p>BUT, there are unofficial hacks to get the Google Camera app to work on the Fairphone 3. I cannot openly recommend where to download these hacks so look them up.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>Battery life is a very subjective thing unless you use some synthetic benchmarks but I&rsquo;m not keen for this stage. At 3060mAh, this capacity seems like an average for phones of this category.</p>
<p>I started off with a full charge in the morning and I used the phone as per normal. I took the following screenshot when I got home.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-battery-page.png"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-battery-page-512x1024.png"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a pretty light user when it comes to phones, I occasionally surf the web, check social media and emails etc. No games, music or video watching. Any heavier work I&rsquo;ll use a PC or tablet. Typically by this time of the day, my 2-year-old (with obviously-deteriorated battery) Pixel 2 would drop to about 40-50%.</p>
<p>So it seems not bad, for a new battery, I should be able to make it last at least 2 days between charges.</p>
<p>If for some reason you always burn through your battery before your day is up, hey, you can always bring a spare battery without the need for a power bank!</p>
<h1 id="gripes">Gripes</h1>
<p>There is quite a list of shortcomings in the design and usability aspects that one usually cannot determine on spec sheets but becomes obvious when using the phone. At least compared to the Pixel 2 and other phones, the FP3 I feel falls short in this areas. Some may not be the fault of the FP3.</p>
<h2 id="charge-status-led--notification-led">Charge Status LED ≠ Notification LED</h2>
<p>When I first saw a front LED light up when I plugged in the charger, I was elated! I haven&rsquo;t used a phone with such an LED in years.</p>

<p>Boy I was let down when I realised that the LED never lit up for any other use-case. Research on Fairphone forums confirms that <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/led-notifications-do-not-work/53013">this LED is to indicate charge status only</a> and there are no plans to change this.</p>
<p>If this was a hardware LED tied to the charging circuit, then nothing more to do here, no changes are possible.</p>
<p>To confirm this, we can bring up the service menu to have some fun. Dial *#*#66#*#*. Go to Service Tests -&gt;  Test Single -&gt; FlashLED Test.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-led-colours.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-led-colours-1024x770.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This proves that the LED is software-controllable. If Fairphone wanted to, it&rsquo;s a technical possibility to make the notification LED feature available to the Android OS and apps just via a software update.</p>

<a href="images/fp3-update-led.png"><img src="images/fp3-update-led.png" width="200"></a>
<p>A recent software update FP3 A.0118 has allowed the LED to be used for notification purposes.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprint-sensor-too-high">Fingerprint sensor too high</h2>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back-fp-sensor.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-back-fp-sensor-536x1024.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The Fingerprint sensor seems to be in an awkwardly high position to me. I always have difficult reaching up to it when I pick up the FP3. I guess in time I&rsquo;ll have no choice but to get used to it though.</p>
<p>The position of the fingerprint sensor is understandably limited due to the position of the battery and the modules below it so the engineers&rsquo; hands were tied but I still feel this is something that should be improved in future.</p>
<h2 id="off-centre-usb-c-port">Off-centre USB-C port</h2>
<p>This is a small issue but something that bugs me. Most of my prior phones before have their charging port placed at the bottom center.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-usbc-off-centre.jpg"><img src="/2019/12/review-and-partial-teardown-of-fairphone-3/images/fp3-usbc-off-centre.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The FP3&rsquo;s USB port is slightly offset to the left. My OCD kicks in!!!</p>
<p>Now I understand that this is due to the design of the modular components but still, it&rsquo;s another design compromise I must stomach.</p>
<h2 id="cases-and-bumpers">Cases and bumpers</h2>
<p>The FP3 comes with a bumper to help protect the phone from drops. Count on that being your only protection case for some time due to the rarity of the phone. I went to a couple of phone shops and none have heard of a Fairphone!</p>
<p>For the Matte screen protector, I had to get a shop to custom cut a plastic screen protector to fit the dimensions of the FP3. Just know what you are getting into when getting an extremely niche phone.</p>
<h2 id="shipping">Shipping</h2>
<p>The FP3 does not ship to Singapore direct. So I had to get it shipped to a European freight-forwarder before getting my hands on it in Singapore.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The FP3 has certain features on paper that are uncommon or rare in modern phones: microSD, removable battery, 3.5mm audio jack, charge status LED, dual-SIM and SIM changing without ejector pin. <strong>By these features alone, I would purchase the FP3 without the other modular, environmental and ethical aspects.</strong></p>
<p>This phone may not fit everyone&rsquo;s needs. For the same specs, one can easily get a phone that is a few hundred dollars cheaper or for the same price, a new Pixel 3a with much better camera software.</p>
<p><strong>Designing a repairable, modular, and sustainable phone by this small limited-resourced social enterprise has its compromises.</strong> You&rsquo;ll have to live with a chunky phone that looks like one made half-decade ago. Unlike a desktop PC, there is only so much a manufacturer can work with in a space-constrained portable device. Software optimisations like the camera for example will have to take a back seat.</p>
<p>You have to pay a premium for the relatively-small production run that obtains materials from &ldquo;more ethical&rdquo; sources.</p>
<p>To prevent the price from climbing to astronomical levels, Fairphone engineers have to use lower-performance components. The phone is noticeably slow today, imagine <a href="https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032971751-Operating-systems-OS-for-the-Fairphone-3">5 years later which Fairphone has promised to support.</a></p>
<p>However if you can live with these compromises like I do, supporting the Fairphone by putting my money where my mouth is feels like the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Given the track record of Fairphone where they are still selling spare parts to their first model sold in 2013, I&rsquo;m confident they&rsquo;ll still be around to do the same for the Fairphone 3. I wish them all the best.</p>
