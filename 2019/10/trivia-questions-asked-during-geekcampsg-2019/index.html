    <p>I was the emcee in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/384878335732606/">GeekcampSG 2019.</a> I asked a total of 66 trivia questions in the effort and excuse to give out leftover plushies from the previous Geekcamp 2018+.</p>
<p><a href="/2019/10/trivia-questions-asked-during-geekcampsg-2019/images/geekcampsg2019-pluhies.jpg.jpg"><img src="/2019/10/trivia-questions-asked-during-geekcampsg-2019/images/geekcampsg2019-pluhies.jpg-1024x389.jpg"></a></p>
<p>These questions spanned topics from Singapore, Science, Fiction, Computing, Retro-tech and miscellaneous general knowledge. Topics I feel would appeal to a stereotypical geek audience and someone like myself. Try to see how many you can answer.</p>
<p>Trust me, the collating of these questions and researching their answers took over a period of several years to prepare for such a day. It was fun to finally see the fruits of my labour. Coming up with questions that can&rsquo;t be too easy that everyone knows the answer or too hard that no one knows is difficult. Fortunately for me, at least 3/4 of the questions could be answered correctly by at least one person.</p>
<h1 id="singapore">Singapore</h1>
<p><strong>SG timezone is +8 but this wasn’t always true. What was our previous time zone and when was the change made?</strong></p>
<p>Previous was UTC+07:30. Deprecated in 1 January 1982.</p>
<p><strong>Our rubbish is incinerated then buried on which island?</strong></p>
<p>Pulau Semakau. Operations started in April 1999 and projected to last to 2035-2045.</p>
<p><strong>When you watch Western law shows, you will notice that they have jury where a panel of ordinary people will decide the verdict instead of the judge. Singapore used to have a jury system up to 1969. Why was this abolished?</strong></p>
<p>This abolishment was largely due to Lee Kuan Yew. He says and I quote “I had no faith in a system that allowed the superstition, ignorance, biases, and prejudices of seven jurymen to determine guilt or innocence&quot; (The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew)</p>
<p><strong>Singapore’s currency has constant parity to which other currency?</strong></p>
<p>Brunei. Currency Interchangeability Agreement in 1967. Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei were the original parties in the agreement. Malaysia pulled out in 1973. This was partly due the to the events of 1971 where the US dollar was decoupled and no longer backed by gold. Google Nixon Shock and Bretton Woods for more info.</p>
<p><strong>We know that the country code for Singapore is +65? Why is that so?</strong></p>
<p>Country codes are assigned by a UN organisation called International Telecommunications Union.</p>
<p>9 Zones worldwide. Singapore is in Zone 6 for South East Asia and Australia. The second digit is roughly the order in which the country became independent or requested from the Union.</p>
<p><strong>Where did this phrase “Little red dot” come from?</strong></p>
<p>It originated from former Indonesian President BJ Habbie in 1998 when he remarked to the Asian Wall Street Journal. “It&rsquo;s O.K. with me, but there are 211 million people (in Indonesia). All the green (area) is Indonesia. And that red dot is Singapore.”</p>
<p><strong>This economic indicator NODX is commonly used by Singapore economists but not so much in other countries. What is it and why is this the case?</strong></p>
<p>Non-oil domestic exports. Oil refinery and export activities contribute about 5% to our GDP which skews our economic performance when lumped with other categories. Therefore economists remove oil figures when it comes to accessing Singapore’s economic health.</p>
<p><strong>On the first noon of every month, why is there a nationwide chime?</strong></p>
<p>To test our SCDF Public Warning System. It is also sounded on other occasions like Total Defence day on 15 February as well as during National Day and Lee Kuan Yew’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>The Straits Time Index or STI is regarded as the benchmark index used in the Singapore stock market. What kind of stocks does it track?</strong></p>
<p>Top 30 companies listed in the Singapore Exchange by market capitalisation</p>
<p><strong>These words Stayers and Quitters caused quite a bit of controversy when a Singapore politician said them. Who said them?</strong></p>
<p>Former PM Goh Chok Tong in 2002 National Day Rally</p>
<p>“Fair-weather Singaporeans will run away whenever the country runs into stormy weather. I call them &ldquo;quitters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, &ldquo;quitters&rdquo; are in the minority. The majority of Singaporeans are &ldquo;stayers&rdquo;. &ldquo;Stayers&rdquo; are committed to Singapore. Rain or shine, they will be with Singapore. As we say in Hokkien, &ldquo;pah see buay zao&rdquo;.”</p>
<p><strong>Which former Singapore minister said the following “The problem now is that under the banyan tree very little else can grow. When state institutions are too pervasive, civic institutions cannot thrive. It&rsquo;s necessary to prune the banyan trees so other plants can grow.”?</strong></p>
<p>George Yeo in 1991 then Minister for Information and the Arts, George Yeo</p>
<p><strong>Who said this and I quote “My attack on Singapore was a bluff – a bluff that worked. I had 30,000 men and was outnumbered more than three to one. I knew if I had to fight long for Singapore I would be beaten.”?</strong></p>
<p>Lt-Gen Tomoyuki Yamashita. Commander of the Japanese 25th Army which invaded Malaya and Singapore. Executed in February 1946 for war crimes.</p>
<p>“That is why the surrender had to be at once. I was frightened all the time that the British would discover our numerical weakness and lack of supplies and force me into disastrous street fighting.”</p>
<p><strong>There was once a time nuclear weapons in Singapore. When did this happen?</strong></p>
<p>1962-1970. 48 tactical nuclear weapons called Red Beard kept at today’s Tengah Air Base. Those weapons were placed here by the British without the knowledge of the Malaysia or Singapore government as part of the Cold War strategy. We only know about this today because the British Ministry of Defence declassified documents in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>This commentary “A Great Affective Divide” made some ministers uncomfortable when it was published in The Straits Times in 1994. Who wrote it?</strong></p>
<p>Catherine Lim. A local fiction author. The essay is about how the government is out of touch with the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>How long can Singapore’s rice reserves last?</strong></p>
<p>3 months. 2 months in government warehouses and one month on supplier side</p>
<p><strong>Why does the licence plates of our SAF vehicles have the MID prefix?</strong></p>
<p>MID stands for Ministry of Interior and Defense.</p>
<p>Lee Kuan Yew from his memoirs The Singapore Story: “To my relief, Goh Keng Swee was willing and eager to take on the task of building up the forces. I decided to have him take charge of home affairs and defence, put together into one ministry called MID (ministry of interior and defence). This would allow him to use the police force to help in the basic training of army recruits.”</p>
<p><strong>What was the lowest temperature ever recorded in Singapore?</strong></p>
<p>19C. Paya Lebar 14 Feb 1989.</p>
<p><strong>What is the first Singapore company to be listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in US?</strong></p>
<p>Creative in 1992. Delisted in 2007. National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations</p>
<p><strong>Who wrote “Please, get out of my elite uncaring face” ?</strong></p>
