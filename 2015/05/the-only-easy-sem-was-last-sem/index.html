    <p>I was not the first person that came up with the title above, but I thought it resonated perfectly with my undergraduate life especially my last few semesters. The last sem is indeed my hardest Sem.</p>
<p>Having just finished my final exam of this semester and of my NUS undergraduate career, I thought I wanna do a “stock-take” on what I did this semester.</p>
<h3 id="tldr-version">Tl;dr version:</h3>
<p>In summary for this semester, I took a level 5000 module, did my FYP + presentation and was a CS2103 tutor to 16 students. I gave 3 talks: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yeokm1/kheng-meng-cs3217-guest-presentation">guest lecture for CS3217 on iOS (Swift) Development</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yeokm1/introduction-to-raspberry-pi-and-linux">workshop on Raspberry Pi/Linux</a> and a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yeokm1/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy">talk/live demo on Bluetooth Low Energy</a>. I volunteered regularly at <a href="http://repairkopitiam.sg/">Repair Kopitiam</a> and <a href="http://www.nus-csc.org/main/yrs.html">Yishun Reading Stars</a>. As if those weren&rsquo;t enough, I still held a part-time job too.</p>
<p>To most of my friends/people who knew me and met me through these events, you couldn&rsquo;t have known I have stretched myself thin to commit to all of these. I now make a belated apology as I only had the personal resources to do the minimum in some of them. In hindsight when I look at these, I still wonder to myself how did I manage to pull them off.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I wrote two posts about my <a href="/2013/08/why-semester-will-be-most-pivotal-me/">most pivotal semester</a> and my <a href="/2014/09/my-brutally-honest-24th-birthday-reflections/">24th birthday reflections</a>, on how tough those times were. This Sem is obviously much more.</p>
<h3 id="repair-kopitiam">Repair Kopitiam</h3>
<p>The most notable new stuff are the <a href="http://repairkopitiam.sg/">Repair Kopitiam</a> and the 3 presentations I gave. I came to know of Repair Kopitiam when I attended some classes at <a href="http://onemakergroup.sg/">One Maker Group</a>. It is basically an voluntary initiative to teach people how to repair their stuff, notably, household appliances, furniture and clothes. I&rsquo;m attached to the appliance area and since then, I have probably taught about a dozen or so people on how to repair their items.</p>
<p>This was a good learning experience for me too. If you ask me, my Computer Science degree was entirely useless in this area. So for most of my skills, I had to learn &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo; and from watching how other repair coaches carry out their duties. In terms of the household appliance department where I help out, I&rsquo;m the youngest and have much to learn from them. Learn and teach at the same time.</p>
<p>The general demographic of the people I help are usually at least in their 40s and older, many of them Mandarin-speaking. Coming from an English-speaking family and in a English-medium university, my conversational Mandarin skills deteriorated from bad to worse in the past few years. Conversing with these older generation though tough for me initially, was a great way to slowly build back my Mandarin speaking skills.</p>
<h3 id="my-presentations">My Presentations</h3>
<p>Never before have I given so many solo presentations in such short span of time. 4 including my FYP. This may seem like very little to some but like I once told a friend from business, business students probably give more presentations in one semester than Computing students give in their entire 4 years. Those 3 are technical presentations with some live demos so they require some effort to prepare for and not something I can just smoke through. Furthermore, they were voluntary and don&rsquo;t contribute to my grades.</p>
<p>Truthfully, the guest lecture, workshop and talk were all actually requested of by people who knew I had the unique knowledge to share (in a short notice). Without them initiating it, I probably would not have done all of them.</p>
<p>It may surprise some of you but I was actually a former debater while in JC and represented my school in inter-JC debate competitions. In spite of that, I am still fearful and get nervous when it comes to public speaking. The 3 presentations did gave me the practice and confidence boost I needed just in time for my FYP. I&rsquo;m pretty sure without those 3 presentations, I will have probably done worse than any FYP grade I will eventually get.</p>
<h3 id="grades">Grades?</h3>
<p>Because of my numerous &ldquo;extra-curricular&rdquo; activities over the years, the opportunity cost on my grades have been huge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say contrary to the expectations of many, I&rsquo;m technically a second-lower, I&rsquo;m 3.97, just 0.03 shy away. I have calculated that the minimum grades I need to get that coveted second-upper is A- for my FYP (worth 3 modules) and B+ for my sole module. Reasonably achievable but there is a chance I still may not get them.</p>
<p>I did ask myself the question if I fail to get Second-Upper, is there anything I could have done better? I already have the answer to that. I could have definitely scrape through if I had done something less any time over my 4 years and put that time to studying that whee bit more. However, that something less would not have made me exactly what I am today and would have impacted someone less in this world.</p>
<p>In short, no regrets.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-next">So what&rsquo;s next?</h3>
<p>Baring any unforeseen circumstances, my undergraduate career has pretty much ended unless I count things like the commencement ceremony. As they say, your learning does not stop when you finish school, rather it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I wrote before that I actually feel that hardware/electronics is what I&rsquo;m also interested in over pure software engineering. I hope to slowly move my career to a healthy mix between the two and my present job seems to allow that.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, I hope to learn how to ride a motorbike, drive a big truck as a civilian (I have a Class 4 military-only driving licence) and FLY a PLANE. The last one is no joke. I still have my childhood dream of flying but did not have the time, money and opportunity to do so. I hope once I earn enough, I can realise those dreams. Till then, back to the realities of the working world.</p>
