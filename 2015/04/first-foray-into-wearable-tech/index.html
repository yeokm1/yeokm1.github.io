    <p>Since I started dabbling with hardware like the Arduino, I have always wondered what it would seem like to integrate it with clothing (materials) but did not find the urge to learn.</p>
<p>After I joined <a href="http://repairkopitiam.sg/">Repair Kopitiam</a> as a voluntary Repair Coach, I was given an apron that both distinguishes us from the participants that we are helping and protects our clothes as well.

<p>So I thought why not take this opportunity to do some wearable tech and 3D print some stuff as well!</p>

<p>A quick video to highlight how it appears.</p>
<h1 id="general-pictures">General Pictures</h1>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/wearable-rk-front.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/wearable-rk-front-1024x765.jpg" alt="wearable-rk-front"></a></p>
<p>The result of more than 7 hours of labour from coding, 3D printing to sewing.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/wearable-rk-back.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/wearable-rk-back-1024x765.jpg" alt="wearable-rk-back"></a></p>
<p>Now you see &ldquo;who&rdquo; is running the show. I have sewn on a small piece of cloth to act as a mini pouch for the 1000 mAh battery.</p>
<h1 id="close-up">Close-up</h1>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-sequin.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-sequin-1024x765.jpg" alt="rk-sequin"></a></p>
<p>This is just one of the 9 LED sequins that are hiding under the letters. My name excluding my surname is 9 letters gosh. I have realised this is longer that most since I was young. Anyway, it means I have a lot more sewing to do.</p>
<p>The letters are 3D-printed as it is near impossible to find products that fit my requirements of the exact size, strength and translucent material.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-lilipad.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-lilipad-1024x765.jpg" alt="rk-lilipad"></a></p>
<p>The one pulling the strings (almost literally).</p>
<p>It is the Arduino Lilypad USB. Think of it as your typical Arduino microcontroller specifically designed for such wearable uses-cases. It is engineered to be washable but I don&rsquo;t intend to test this anytime soon. This particular Arduino comes with an integrated battery charger which is more useful in the long run than other physically smaller alternatives.</p>
<p>I had to max out all of the 9 output pins to control the 9 individual LEDs, &ldquo;curse&rdquo; my long name again.</p>
<p>The thing to note here is the 470-ohm resistor I placed on the ground wire. The resistor serves 2 functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Slightly dim the LEDs as the standard 3.3V supplied to the LEDs makes them too bright.</li>
<li>Prevent the Arduino from &ldquo;bursting into flames&rdquo; if anything is shorted to the ground wire. This is a preventative measure as I anticipate this possibility due to the proximity of the ground wire to other wires.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-conductive-thread.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-conductive-thread-1024x765.jpg" alt="rk-conductive-thread"></a></p>
<p>If you thought managing 9 different LEDs is hard, think about how am I going to connect them? Unlike conventional electronics planning where I can just use jumper wires, I have to SEW them! Imagine what happens if I make a mistake like wire wrongly or accidentally cut something which I actually made many times.</p>
<p>The wire I&rsquo;m using is a a stainless steel conductive thread. 2-ply for LED wire and 3-ply for the shared ground wire. I would prefer the stronger 3-ply thread for everything but it is actually very difficult to thread this through the needle much less sew that in the first place. So I only used it for the more sensitive ground wire since it is shared.</p>
<p>The stainless steel thread also has a habit of fraying much more than the conventional cotton threads we are used to so it made my life even harder.</p>
<p><a href="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-glow-in-dark.jpg"><img src="/2015/04/first-foray-into-wearable-tech/images/rk-glow-in-dark-1024x765.jpg" alt="rk-glow-in-dark"></a></p>
<p>Did I mention the 3D printing material I used glows in the dark too? I printed at 40% infill instead of the standard 20% to increase the glowing effect but I should have gone even higher instead.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If you wish to know more about the technical details behind this project, the code for the Arduino is pushed to a <a href="https://github.com/yeokm1/name-blinker">Github project</a>. As a potential expansion, I may consider adding a flexible solar panel so I will never again have to charge this project from the wall. Talk about truly sustainable living.</p>
<p>Hope this will inspire you to consider implementing your own wearable projects too!</p>
